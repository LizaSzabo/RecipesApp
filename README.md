# RecipesApp
The application can be started with the <i>main</i> function in the <i>Main.kt</i> class.

On the first window there will appear a list of recipe titles, after they are successfully fetched from the API.
In the search box you can enter the full name of a dish type (ex. lunch, dinner, dessert, ...). 
By clicking the <i>Search</i> button you will get the result list filtered by the given dish type.

With double-clicking one of the list items, there will open a new window, showing the details of the selected recipe.
